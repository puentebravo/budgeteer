# Budgeteer ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

## Description

We've all been there; whether for pleasure or business, you get home from a trip abroad and suddenly discover you went _way_ over budget. Tracking expenditures overseas sounds as easy as logging onto your banking app of choice, but roaming data usage is expensive - and sometimes, spotty. Enter the Budgeteer - an ultra simplified, installable budget tracking app that allows you to track your spending no matter your data connection.
